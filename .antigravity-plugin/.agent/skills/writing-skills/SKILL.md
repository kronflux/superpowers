# Writing Skills

## Overview

**Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

**Personal skills live in your runtime's skills directory** 

You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand .agent/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md before using this skill. That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.

**Official guidance:** For Anthropic's official skill authoring best practices, see anthropic-best-practices.md. This document provides additional patterns and guidelines that complement the TDD-focused approach in this skill.

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future agents find and apply effective approaches.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides

**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once

## TDD Mapping for Skills

| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |
| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |
| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |
| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |
| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |
| **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill |
| **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses |
| **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations |
| **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies |
| **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify |

The entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

## When to Create a Skill

**Create when:**
- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you
- You'd reference this again across projects
- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)
- Others would benefit

**Don't create for:**
- One-off solutions
- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere
- Project-specific conventions (put in your instructions file)
- Mechanical constraints (if it's enforceable with regex/validation, automate it—save documentation for judgment calls)

## Skill Types

### Technique
Concrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)

### Pattern
Way of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)

### Reference
API docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs)

Directory structure and separate-file guidance: `references/authoring-reference.md`.

## SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter (YAML):**
- Two required fields: `name` and `description` (see [agentskills.io/specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for all supported fields)
- Max 1024 characters total
- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no parentheses, special chars)
- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)
  - Start with "Use when..." to focus on triggering conditions
  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts
  - **NEVER summarize the skill's process or workflow** (see `references/discovery-optimization.md` for why)
  - Keep under 500 characters if possible

## Fork Conventions (Superpowers)

This fork extends the base skill format with four conventions every new or edited skill MUST follow.

### Router-style frontmatter `description`

For workflow skills routed by `.agent/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md`, write a trigger-rich `description`: start with the imperative use-condition, then list concrete trigger phrases, then `Routed by <skill>`. Do NOT summarize the workflow (SDO rule still applies). Example:

```yaml
description: >
  Use when <condition>. Triggers on: "<phrase>", "<phrase>". Routed by
  using-superpowers or <handoff-skill>.
```

### Named agents

When a skill dispatches review/analysis agents, reference them by namespace: `.agent/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md`, `.agent/skills/red-team/SKILL.md`. Always provide a `general-purpose` Task fallback + inline template for when the named agent is absent. Never set `subagent_type:"Bash"`.

### Context-engine files (existence-gated)

Skills may read context-engine artifacts — `context-snapshot.json`, `project-map.md`, `state.md`, `known-issues.md` — but EVERY reference MUST be gated on existence (`If <file> exists at the project root, …`) with a native fallback, so the skill runs standalone. Internal skills (e.g. `self-consistency-reasoner`) are gated on skill presence (`If the <skill> skill is installed, …`).

### Micro-task exemption

`.agent/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md` pre-screens micro tasks (typo fix, single rename, ≤1-line config change) past all workflow ceremony. Process skills MUST respect that exemption — do not force ceremony on typo-level changes.

### context-mode awareness

Any skill with a data-processing surface (web fetch, build runs, unbounded Bash, analysis reads, count/filter greps) MUST link `skills/shared/context-mode-adapter.md` rather than emitting `curl`/`wget`/`read_url_content`/"Read directly"/"Grep to locate" directives — those are hard-blocked or nudged when context-mode is active. State-probes, mutations, file writes, and git stay native.

Skill discovery optimization — description field, keyword coverage, descriptive naming, token efficiency, cross-referencing other skills: `references/discovery-optimization.md`.

Flowchart usage, code examples, and file organization: `references/authoring-reference.md`.

## The Iron Law (Same as TDD)

```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

This applies to NEW skills AND EDITS to existing skills.

Write skill before testing? Delete it. Start over.
Edit skill without testing? Same violation.

**No exceptions:**
- Not for "simple additions"
- Not for "just adding a section"
- Not for "documentation updates"
- Don't keep untested changes as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" while running tests
- Delete means delete

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** The .agent/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md skill explains why this matters. Same principles apply to documentation.

Testing approaches per skill type — discipline, technique, pattern, reference: `references/testing-skill-types.md`.

## Common Rationalizations for Skipping Testing

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Skill is obviously clear" | Clear to you ≠ clear to other agents. Test it. |
| "It's just a reference" | References can have gaps, unclear sections. Test retrieval. |
| "Testing is overkill" | Untested skills have issues. Always. 15 min testing saves hours. |
| "I'll test if problems emerge" | Problems = agents can't use skill. Test BEFORE deploying. |
| "Too tedious to test" | Testing is less tedious than debugging bad skill in production. |
| "I'm confident it's good" | Overconfidence guarantees issues. Test anyway. |
| "Academic review is enough" | Reading ≠ using. Test application scenarios. |
| "No time to test" | Deploying untested skill wastes more time fixing it later. |

**All of these mean: Test before deploying. No exceptions.**

## Match the Form to the Failure

Before writing guidance, classify the baseline failure. The form that bulletproofs one failure type measurably backfires on another.

| Baseline failure | Right form | Wrong form |
|---|---|---|
| Skips/violates a rule under pressure (knows better, does it anyway) | Prohibition + rationalization table + red flags (see Bulletproofing below) | Soft guidance ("prefer...", "consider...") |
| Complies, but output has the wrong shape (bloated prompt, buried verdict, restated spec) | Positive recipe or contract: state what the output IS — its parts, in order | Prohibition list ("don't restate", "never narrate") |
| Omits a required element from something they already produce | Structural: REQUIRED field or slot in the template they fill in | Prose reminders near the template |
| Behavior should depend on a condition | Conditional keyed to an observable predicate ("if the brief exists, reference it") | Unconditional rule + exemption clauses |

Why prohibitions backfire on shaping problems, and the rules for whichever form you pick (no nuance clauses; exemption clauses don't scope): `references/bulletproofing.md`.

## Bulletproofing Skills Against Rationalization

Skills that enforce discipline (like TDD) need to resist rationalization. Agents are smart and will find loopholes when under pressure.

**Scope:** this toolkit is for discipline failures — an agent that knows the rule and skips it under pressure. For wrong-shaped output or omitted elements, prohibition-based bulletproofing backfires; use the forms in Match the Form to the Failure instead.

**Psychology note:** Understanding WHY persuasion techniques work helps you apply them systematically. See persuasion-principles.md for research foundation (Cialdini, 2021; Meincke et al., 2025) on authority, commitment, scarcity, social proof, and unity principles.

Techniques with worked examples — close every loophole, spirit-vs-letter, build the rationalization table, create the red-flags list, update SDO for violation symptoms: `references/bulletproofing.md`.

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills

Follow the TDD cycle:

### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline)

Run pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior:
- What choices did they make?
- What rationalizations did they use (verbatim)?
- Which pressures triggered violations?

This is "watch the test fail" - you must see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.

### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill

Write skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases.

Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.

### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes

Agent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof.

Micro-test wording before running full pressure scenarios: `references/testing-skill-types.md`.

**Testing methodology:** See [testing-skills-with-subagents.md](testing-skills-with-subagents.md) for the complete testing methodology:
- How to write pressure scenarios
- Pressure types (time, sunk cost, authority, exhaustion)
- Plugging holes systematically
- Meta-testing techniques

Anti-patterns to avoid: `references/authoring-reference.md`.

Deployment gate, the full skill-creation checklist, and the discovery workflow: `references/deployment-checklist.md`.

## The Bottom Line

**Creating skills IS TDD for process documentation.**

Same Iron Law: No skill without failing test first.
Same cycle: RED (baseline) → GREEN (write skill) → REFACTOR (close loopholes).
Same benefits: Better quality, fewer surprises, bulletproof results.

If you follow TDD for code, follow it for skills. It's the same discipline applied to documentation.
